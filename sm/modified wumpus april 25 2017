Welcome to Hunt the Wumpus!

The Wumpus lives in a cave of 20 rooms. Each room has 3 tunnels leading to
other rooms. (Look at a dodecahedron to see how this works-if you don't
know what a dodecahedron is, ask someone).

HAZARDS:

Bottomless pits - two rooms have bottomless pits in them if you go there,
  you fall into the pit (& lose!)

Super bats - two other rooms have super bats. if you go there, a bat grabs
  you and takes you to some other room at random (which might be
  troublesome).

WUMPUS:

The Wumpus is not bothered by the hazards (it has sucker feet and is too
big for a bat to lift). Usually it is asleep. Two things wake it up: your
entering its room or your shooting an arrow. If the wumpus wakes, it moves
one room or stays still. After that, if it is where you are, it eats you up
(& you lose!)

YOU:

Each turn you may move or shoot a "crooked arrow".
  Moving: You can go one room (through one tunnel).

Arrows: You have 5 arrows. You lose when you run out. Each arrow can go
  from 1 to 5 rooms. You aim by telling the computer the room numbers you
  want the arrow to go to. If the arrow can't go that way (ie no tunnel) it
  moves at ramdom to the next room.

  If the arrow hits the wumpus, you win.
  If the arrow hits you, you lose.

WARNINGS:
    When you are one room away from wumpus or hazard, the computer says:

  Wumpus- 'I smell a wumpus'
  Bat - 'Bats nearby'
  Pit - 'I feel a draft'
